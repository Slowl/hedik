# My personal website and playground
My minimalistic website and playground where I display my work but also try things out.
Built with Astro to allow myself to use React.js in the future and try other libs/framework (Svelte, Solid.js ?).

## Technical stack
- Typescript
- Astro
- Sanity CMS
- Sendgrid
